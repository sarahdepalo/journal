# Week 09 

*Prompt: Travel, surfing, or movies? Which topic would you find the most interesting to develop an app around?*

I’m interested in all three of these topics, but if I had to choose one, I think it’d be surfing. I’ve done a lot of projects so far based around movies or shows, so I’d like to move away from that topic. I would choose travel, but I’m not sure how I can improve upon existing travel sites or what I’d include in one. I’ve only gone surfing a couple times, but I love the colors and aesthetic of surfing imagery, so I think it’d be fun to make an app involving surfing! I’m excited to start projects this week and am interested in what they will involve this time.
