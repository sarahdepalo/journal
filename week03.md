# Perspective Changes Towards the Internet

Prior to being a student at DigitalCrafts, I designed simple sites using platforms like Wix and Shopify. After a couple weeks of working at that job, I noticed that I started to consume content on the internet differently. I paid closer attention to layout, color schemes, typography, and even logos. The only time I went into the dev tools was to mine the client's old site for favicons and logos that weren't readily available to download. Now that we're diving into CSS and HTML in class, the way I consume content on the internet has changed again. The dev tools are no longer scary (although still a bit overwhelming) and my thoughts have shifted away from "I like that design" to "I wonder how they did that".

My favorite part about my last job was designing fun and visually pleasing sites. Ideally, I'd like to graduate bootcamp and be able create web designs that I could never achieve in Wix or a similar platform. Now, each time I visit a site, I find myself opening dev tools to gain a glimpse of all the working parts behind the site. I'm also constantly looking for new developers to follow and learn from on Instagram, Dribble, Medium, and other platforms. Once we get into JavaScript, I'm sure my experience using the internet will change yet again. Right now, the backend of the internet is kinda like a black hole to me; I'm not sure how it works, but I'm really interested in finding out (hopefully through reading articles and not by flying into a black hole)!
