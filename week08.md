# Week 08 - Brainstorming

Prompt: What kind of review blog would you actually like to create?  

When thinking about a review blog to create, I bounced between restaurants and comics, but  ultimately landed on the super specific topic of Cartoon Network shows. I have a weird amount of knowledge of Cartoon Network shows from the 90’s to early 00’s and figured this might be my only time to put that knowledge to use. I was obsessed with some of the cartoons that were broadcasted on Cartoon Network as a kid, such as the Grim Adventures of Billy and Mandy, Samurai Jack, Teen Titans and so much more. Even as an adult I enjoy some of the newer shows like Adventure Time, Regular Show, and Steven’s Universe. If you include extensions of Cartoon Network like Toonami and Boomerang, this site would be gigantic, but I’m excited to create a mini version or draft of the review site.
