# Week 05 - Reflecting on the Past Month

More than a month has passed since the beginning of bootcamp and I can already tell attending this school is one of the best decisions I’ve made. If you told me even two months ago that I’d be coding everyday and actually like it, I would’ve thought you were crazy. I’ve tried many things in my young adult life in an attempt to find my “thing”. I’ve failed many times and even achieved a huge goal of mine last year only to have those plans completely derailed by COVID. This turned out to be a blessing in disguise because it pushed me away from teaching and into the tech world. Teaching brought me a lot of stress and anxiety and I feel about 10x happier coding than I do teaching. I know it is early on in the program, but I’m really excited to develop this passion further each day and tackle all of the upcoming back-end topics!
