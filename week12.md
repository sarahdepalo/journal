# Week 12

*Prompt: If you could redo one project, what would it be and how would you redo it?*


If I could redo one project, I think it would be Walk Disney/Mouse Guide. Having learned a bit of React, I think it would be so much easier to accomplish our vision of adding different activities based on parks. I really enjoy working with Node and Express, but think that React is a bit more intuitive. I’m a big fan of being able to pass props and update the state (hoping I got these terms right haha) without having to refresh the page. If we built Walk Disney with React, I think we could’ve taken it to a whole different level. I’m looking forward to diving deeper into React and trying out all the cool things it lets us do.
